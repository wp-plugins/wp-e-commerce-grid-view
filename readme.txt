= Cross Browser Compatibility =

WP e-Commerce Grid View has been tested on the default WordPress themes and it is tested 100% compatible with all browsers. 

= Pro Version Upgrade =

For those who want crystal clear product card images and a beautiful mobile and tablet responsive display there is a PRO Version upgrade. Features include:

* Fully mobile and tablet responsive Grid View display (providing of course that your theme is responsive) 
* WP e-Commerce does not support scaling Grid View product feature images to the grid view product card dimensions. It shows a cropped and often distorted part of the image and looks ugly. 
* WP e-Commerce Grid View Pro fixes this for you by auto scales the products feature image so they they also show perfectly on the Grid View Product cards. 
* It does not matter what size or dimensions the product feature image is - Grid View Pro automatically scales it to show the whole image inside the product card image container.
* Images are scaled from the centre of the container for a perfect display everytime.
